# Reinforcement Learning Lab

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Lab repository! In this repository, you'll find implementations of various reinforcement learning experiments and demonstrations. Below is a brief overview of the experiments included in this repository:

## Experiments

1. **Demonstration of tools and libraries of Reinforcement Learning & Implementation of MDP for a specific application**
   
   This experiment focuses on showcasing various tools and libraries commonly used in reinforcement learning. Additionally, it includes the implementation of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a specific application.

2. **Implementation of Model-free control: Q-Learning/SARSA**
   
   This experiment involves the implementation of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for model-free control. These algorithms are fundamental in reinforcement learning and are used for learning optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes.

3. **Implementation of Multi-arm bandit problem for a specific application**
   
   The multi-arm bandit problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an agent must decide which actions (arms) to take in order to maximize cumulative reward. This experiment implements the multi-arm bandit problem for a specific application.

4. **Implementation of Deep Q Learning for a specific application**
   
   Deep Q Learning (DQL) is a powerful technique that combines reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. In this experiment, we implement DQL for a specific application, leveraging the expressive power of neural networks to learn complex policies.
